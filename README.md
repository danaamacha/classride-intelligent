# ClassRide Intelligent
AI / Machine Learning Project

## Overview
ClassRide Intelligent is an AI-based system that optimizes student transportation by automatically assigning students to buses and generating efficient routes based on students’ home locations, university schedules, and bus capacity constraints.

## Problem Statement
Manual student transportation planning is time-consuming, inefficient, and error-prone. Educational institutions often rely on manual planning that fails to consider optimal routing, capacity balancing, and time efficiency.

## Objectives
- Automate student-to-bus assignment
- Optimize bus routes using data-driven techniques
- Reduce travel time and fuel consumption
- Improve reliability and scalability of student transportation systems

## Status
Project initialization and planning phase.
